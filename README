nnnn20430's stupid web service package.

Includes nginx, uwsgi, php, mariadb, git, fossil.

software in src/ needs to be unpacked and build in appropriate builds/(software)/(software_src_dir)
then link to latest software build dir in builds/(software)/latest -> (software_src_dir)
will maybe eventually automate this using ./build script

to create user/group and set appropriate file permissions:
root # ./integrate

start the web service:
root # ./launcher -a start
or to stop it:
root # ./launcher -a stop
