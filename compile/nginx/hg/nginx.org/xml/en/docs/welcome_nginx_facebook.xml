<initial>Q:</initial>
I am trying to open Facebook, Yahoo!, Yandex, Google, or some
other well known web site and instead I am getting a blank web page
with a message referring to nginx: &ldquo;Welcome to nginx!&rdquo; or
&ldquo;404 Not Found / nginx&rdquo;.
</para>

<para>
I suspect something is wrong and there is probably a malicious attempt
to direct me to a rogue web page (to break into my computer, do
phishing etc.). Why is that, and what has nginx to do with my attempts
to connect to Facebook (Yahoo!, Google, etc.) ?

First of all, the &ldquo;Welcome to nginx!&rdquo; page you see is
NOT our website. At nginx, we write and distribute a <b>free</b>
<link url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">
open source</link> web server software. A web page saying
&ldquo;Welcome to nginx!&rdquo; is just a diagnostics response that
can be produced by any of the websites out there, running nginx
web server. Currently, nginx is the 2nd most popular open source
web server in the world, it’s being used by over 126,000,000 (or
14% of the Internet) websites. Most of these websites are
legitimate, but some aren’t. Our software was created with a good
reason of enabling performance and scalability on the Internet,
it is licensed under <link url="http://nginx.org/LICENSE">
popular open source license</link>, and has nothing to do with any
kind of threatening or malicious activity per se &#8212;
nginx is NOT a malware, and it is NOT on your computer. But someone’s
malware could have indeed tampered with your computer or router,
redirecting you to a fraudulent Internet server.

We recommend running an anti-virus check on your computer, and
we recommend to check and verify your entire system setup with the

<listitem>
Check your TCP/IP settings and see if the DNS servers
configuration matches the valid one (suggested by your Internet
service provider or IT support personnel).
</listitem>

<listitem>
Use <link url="http://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/">Google
Public DNS</link>, and see if it fixes the problem. From Google’s
description of its Public DNS &#8212; "Google Public DNS is a free,
global Domain Name System (DNS) resolution service,
that you can use as an alternative to your current DNS
provider. [..] By using Google Public DNS you can: Speed up your
browsing experience. <b>Improve your security</b>."

Clear your DNS resolver cache. On Microsoft Windows XP go to
Start > Run, and then type the following command:
"ipconfig /flushdns". On Microsoft Vista, Windows 7, and
Windows 8 click on Start logo, follow All Programs > Accessories,
right-click on Command Prompt, choose "Run As Administrator",
type in "ipconfig /flushdns" and hit Enter.

<listitem>
Click the "page reload" button in your browser. Clear browser
data (cache, cookies etc.). E.g. with Chrome find and click
"Clear Browsing Data" (Settings > Under the Hood). With Internet
Explorer find Tools > Internet Options > General.
<b>Caution:</b> you may be deleting saved passwords information
here, so do it carefully and check what exact actions you are
performing.

<listitem>
Check if the "hosts" file doesn’t contain entries other
than "127.0.0.1 localhost", and if so &#8212; if these entries are for
the web site you’re trying to reach. The "hosts" files is located in
C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc directory. Typically there should
be just one entry in it, for "127.0.0.1 localhost", that’s it. The
"hosts" file can be viewed and edited with your standard
Notepad application.
</listitem>

<listitem>
Check the plugins and extensions installed with your browser.
Re-install your browser or try an alternative one if possible.

<para>
Something must be wrong with your <b>operating
system</b> settings, <b>home router</b> setup, or <b>browser</b>
configuration, if you are trying to access a well known web site
and what you get instead is &ldquo;Welcome to nginx!&rdquo;.
This should NOT happen if your computers and network are
clean and safe.
</para>

<para>
If changing DNS servers to Google Public DNS, flushing DNS resolver
cache, fixing your browser configuration, or cleaning "hosts" file
(when applicable) have helped, it might be that there’s a malware
somewhere on your PC or around. Find and clean it using
your preferred anti-virus and anti-malware tools.
