<para>
To quickly set up NGINX Plus environment on AWS:
<list type="bullet" compact="no">
<listitem>
Follow
<link url="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/GettingStartedGuide/Welcome.html">
Getting Started with EC2</link> guide to sign up to AWS and
get more information about EC2 itself.
Then you can proceed to
<link url="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00A04GAG4/ref=_ptnr_doc_">
NGINX Plus Amazon Linux AMI</link> or
<link url="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00DIF4A6Y/ref=_ptnr_doc_">
NGINX Plus Ubuntu AMI</link> product page on AWS Marketplace and launch the AMI.
When configuring the firewall rules, it is necessary to add a rule
to accept web traffic on TCP ports 80 and 443 (“1-click launch”
will do that automatically).
</listitem>

<listitem>
As soon as the new instance is launched, NGINX Plus will be automatically
started and configured to serve default index.html page.
You can check it by pointing your web browser to the public DNS
name of your newborn EC2 instance.
Also, you can log in to your instance and use
<programlisting>
/etc/init.d/nginx status
</programlisting>
to check the status of your NGINX Plus server.
</listitem>

<listitem>
To configure NGINX Plus for use with different web frameworks
quickly and efficiently, you can use a special helper script
included in the AMI.
Log in to your EC2 instance and start:

<programlisting>
nginx-setup
</programlisting>
</listitem>

<listitem>
You will be asked to select what components to install.
Please check the next section in this document for
list of available software components.
After you have selected the necessary component, the script
will automatically install all prerequisite packages
and prepare the necessary configuration.
There will be a separate user created too,
and then a sample web application is started to ensure everything
is working correctly.
</listitem>

<listitem>
After the installation completes and the web application is installed
in a subdirectory inside <path>/var/www</path>,
additional instructions will be provided on how to start/stop sample
application.
For example, the Rails/Unicorn application will reside in
<path>/var/www/rails/sample-unicorn</path>, and specific part of nginx
configuration will be in <path>/etc/nginx/conf.d/rails-unicorn.conf</path>.
Installed application and configuration files can be used as a basis
for further development.
