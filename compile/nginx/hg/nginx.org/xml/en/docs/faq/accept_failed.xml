Such errors stem from the connections that the clients managed
to close before nginx was able to process them. For instance, this can
happen in a situation when the user didn’t wait for a page
heavily populated with images to load fully, and clicked on a
different link. In this case user’s browser would close all of
the prior connections which aren’t longer necessary.
It is a non-critical error.
