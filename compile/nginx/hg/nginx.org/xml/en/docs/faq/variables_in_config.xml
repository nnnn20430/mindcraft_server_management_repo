Is there a proper way to use nginx variables to make sections of
the configuration shorter, using them as macros for making
parts of configuration work as templates?

Variables should not be used as template macros. Variables are
evaluated in the run-time during the processing of each
request, so they are rather costly compared to plain static
configuration. Using variables to store static strings is also
a bad idea. Instead, a macro expansion and "include" directives
should be used to generate configs more easily and it can be
done with the external tools, e.g. sed + make or any other
common template mechanism.
