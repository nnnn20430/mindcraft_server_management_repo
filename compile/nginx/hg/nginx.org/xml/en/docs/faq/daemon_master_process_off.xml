Can I run nginx with "daemon off" or "master_process off" settings
in a production environment?

<initial>A:</initial>
First of all, both "daemon on|off" and "master_process on|off" directives were
intended to be used primarily for nginx code development.
</para>

<para>
While many people use "daemon off" in production it wasnâ€™t really meant for
that. Since version 1.0.9 it is now quite safe to run nginx in production
with "daemon off", though. Bear in mind that non-stop upgrade is not an
option with "daemon off".
</para>

<para>
In a development environment, using "master_process off", nginx can run in
the foreground without the master process and can be terminated simply
with ^C (SIGINT). This is somewhat similar to running Apache with
an 'X' command-line option. However you should NEVER run nginx in production
with "master_process off".
